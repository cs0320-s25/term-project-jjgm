> **GETTING STARTED:** The Maps gearup code is a great starting point for both the backend and frontend. You might also want to grab code snippets from your final REPL project.

# Project Details

Web app made in React that uses Mapbox for the frontend and Firebase for authentication

# Design Choices

Pin data is currently mocked for simplicity-- however it is able to successfully persist between page reloads.

# Errors/Bugs

None

# Tests

Test for login, test for pin placement, test for clearing pins, test for pin persistence through page reload

# How to

Run the client with "npm start" in client/, run the server with "./run" in server/. The page will spin up on localhost:8000

# Collaboration
