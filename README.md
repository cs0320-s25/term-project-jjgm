## Design Choices

Pin data is currently mocked for simplicity-- however it is able to successfully persist between page reloads. Even though it's not a real database, our PinDataStore uses localStorage so that pins stay visible even after you reload the page. This means every userâ€™s pin is saved and reloaded. We also refresh the pins every few seconds to simulate a live updates.

## Errors/Bugs

None

## Tests

Test for login, test for pin placement, test for clearing pins, test for pin persistence through page reload

## How to

Run the client with "npm start" in client/, run the server with "./run" in server/. The page will spin up on localhost:8000

## Collaboration
